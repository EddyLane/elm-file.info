{-| Provides an interface to upload files to a remote destination, but needs a whole bunch of wiring to hook it up

The reason this package makes you fill in so many blanks is because it is a trick subject.
There are many ways to do uploads, so we hope that you can fill in the blanks.


# Uploader

When you need to create an uploader you first need to init the state:

    import File.Upload as Upload

    -- You need to keep track of the uploader state in your model

    type alias Model =
        { upload : Upload.State }


    -- The uploader needs to be initialized

    initialState : Upload.State
    initialState =
        { upload = Upload.init }


    -- You need to then configure the uploader, starting with a NoOp message; a custom type which takes no arguments.

    uploadConfig : Upload.Config Msg
    uploadConfig =
        Upload.config NoOp

    -- You can then add the uploader to your view

    Upload.view state config
